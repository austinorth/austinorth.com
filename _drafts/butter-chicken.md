### Ingredients
- 2lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 4tsp kosher salt
- Black pepper, to taste
- 3tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Ginger 2in peeled and minced
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1.5 tablespoons garam masala
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 28 oz crushed tomato
- 1 cup plain whole milk yogurt
- basmati rice, cooked, for serving
- naan bread, for serving

### Garnish
- fresh cilantro

### Preparation
1. On a cutting board, pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season
chicken on both sides with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Set aside.
2. Set Instant Pot to high on the sauté setting. Melt the butter in the pot,
then add the onion and sauté until it begins to soften, 4 minutes. Add the
garlic and ginger and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes.  3.
Add the remaining 3 teaspoons salt, the paprika, garam masala, and curry powder.
Cook, stirring, until the spices are aromatic and toasted, about 1 minute.  4.
Add the crushed tomatoes and the chicken and stir to combine. Place the lid on
the Instant Pot and seal to close. Set the machine to pressure cook on high and
cook for 5 minutes.  5. Turn off the Instant Pot and let it vent naturally for
10 minutes. Then turn the quick release seal to “vent” and allow any remaining
steam to vent.  6. Remove the lid. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a
cutting board. When cool enough to handle, cut into bite-sized pieces.  7. Set
the machine to high on the sauté setting. Cook sauce until it is reduced by
half, 10–15 minutes.  . Add the yogurt to the sauce and stir to combine. Return
the chicken to the pot and stir to coat completely with sauce.  8. Serve chicken
with basmati rice and naan and garnish with cilantro.
9. Enjoy!
