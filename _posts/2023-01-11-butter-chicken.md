### Ingredients
- 2lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 4tsp kosher salt
- Black pepper, to taste
- 3tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Ginger 2in peeled and minced
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1.5 tablespoons garam masala
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 28 oz crushed tomato
- 1 cup plain whole milk yogurt
- 2 cups of basmati rice
- naan bread, for serving

### Garnish
- fresh cilantro

### Preparation

#### The Rice
1. Measure the two cups of Basmati rice into a strainer and rinse
   thoroughly, dump into Instant Pot.
2. Close the lid and vent and set to Rice setting on Less, cook for
   8min. While this is cooking, you can begin preparing the ingredients
   for the chicken.
3. Turn off the Instant Pot and let it vent naturally for 10min. Then
   transfer the rice to a medium bowl and set aside.
4. Clean out the Instant Pot and prepare to make the chicken.

#### The Chicken
1. On a cutting board, prepare all vegetables and set aside.
2. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season chicken on both
   sides with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Set aside.
3. Set Instant Pot to high on the sauté setting. Melt the butter in the
   pot, then add the onion and sauté until it begins to soften, 4
   minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until softened, stirring
   occasionally, 2 minutes.
4. Add the remaining 3 teaspoons salt, the paprika, garam masala, and
   curry powder.  Cook, stirring, until the spices are aromatic and
   toasted, about 1 minute.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes and the chicken and stir to combine. Place
   the lid on the Instant Pot and seal to close. Set the machine to
   pressure cook on high and cook for 8 minutes.
6. Turn off the Instant Pot and let it vent naturally for 10 minutes.
   Then turn the quick release seal to “vent” and allow any remaining
   steam to vent.
7. Remove the lid. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a cutting board.
   When cool enough to handle, cut into bite-sized pieces.
8. Set the machine to high on the sauté setting. Cook sauce until it is
   reduced by half, 10–15 minutes.
9. Add the yogurt to the sauce and stir to combine. Return the chicken
   to the pot and stir to coat completely with sauce.
10. Serve chicken with basmati rice and naan and garnish with cilantro.
11. Enjoy!
